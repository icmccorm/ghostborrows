error[E0382]: use of moved value: `r1`
 --> tests/ui/fail/prevent_splitting_mut.rs:7:30

5 |     value.borrow_mut(|r1, token1| {
  |                       -- move occurs because `r1` has type `RefReserved<'_, i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
6 |         let activated = r1.activate(token1);
  |                            ---------------- `r1` moved due to this method call
7 |         activated.borrow_mut(|_, _| {
  |                              ^^^^^^ value used here after move
8 |             let (_, _) = r1.split();
  |                          -- use occurs due to use in closure

note: `RefReserved::<'tag, T>::activate` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `r1`
