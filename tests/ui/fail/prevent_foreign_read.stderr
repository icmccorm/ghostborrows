error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `r1`
 --> tests/ui/fail/prevent_foreign_read.rs:6:30

4 |     Value::new(1).borrow_mut(|r1, token1| {
  |                               -- move occurs because `r1` has type `RefReserved<'_, i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
5 |         let activated = r1.activate(token1);
  |                            ---------------- `r1` moved due to this method call
6 |         activated.borrow_mut(|_, _| {
  |                              ^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
7 |             print!("{}", *r1);
  |                           -- borrow occurs due to use in closure

note: `RefReserved::<'tag, T>::activate` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `r1`
