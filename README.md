Ghost Borrows is a static API for safely handling reference to raw pointer conversion using *Ghost Permissions*. This technique was used to implement the [GhostCell](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/) type and it is foundational to the [Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus) deductive verifier. Here, we use the same approach
to manage the *provenance* of references under Rust's [Tree Borrows](https://github.com/Vanille-N/tree-borrows/blob/master/full/main.pdf) aliasing model.

It is sometimes necessary for developers to cast Rust's safe reference types (`&T`, `&mut T`) into raw pointers (`*const T`, `*mut T`). The borrow checker does not restrict raw pointer use, but it still makes aliasing assumptions based on the origin, or *provenance*, of a pointer. If raw pointers are used incorrectly, it can lead to [undefined behavior](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html). 

Currently, most Rust developers who write `unsafe` code use [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) to dynamically detect aliasing violations. [Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus), a deductive verifier, can statically ensure that raw pointers are used safely in certain situations, but it does not yet support reasoning about the provenance of pointers cast from reference types. This library provides a minimal, proof-of-concept extension to Verus' model of ghost permissions to support static validation of raw pointers cast from references under the Tree Borrows aliasing model.
